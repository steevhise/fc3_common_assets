**Freecycle 3.0 Common Assets**

This is common front-end javascript, sass, images, and template partials. 
The intent is to make it easily reusable on any of the FC3 web applications,
As well as be a platform for a static site if we need it.

TODO: this all needs to get copied/installed into whatever project.
We'll probably use Webpack to do that.
